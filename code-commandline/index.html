Directories

List directory contents: 
Ls = will just list all the contents of your current directory (is “dir” on a pc)
Navigate directories on computer: 
cd directoryname or cd directory1/directory2 = change directory or multiple levels
cd .. = takes you up a directory 
cd / = takes you to the root directory -- outside of user directory
mkdir directoryname = make a directory
rm -r directoryname = remove all files in a directory
rm directoryname = just remove that one directory file

Files 


touch filename.html = create any file!
open filename.html = will open in the default program for that file
open filename.html -a “Program Name” = will open in the default program for that file (program name is case sensitive)
Rename file:
mv index.html index2.html = will file name from index.html to index2.html -- and I think if you didn’t put the next file name it would just delete the file.
Mv folder1 folder2 = this will move one folder1 to folder2
Autocomplete:
Hit tab while you’re typing something and it will run through your previous commands. 

Most useful operations

Open a folder in finder
open . = will open the current folder you’re in within terminal in the finder
Hitting up and down arrows
Will go through all your previous commands
Clear screen
Command + k

Definitions Terminal vs. Shell vs. Console (Command line being the most all encompassing term?)


Terminal: Just a graphical interface for the shell / command line that will work within OSX -- a graphical interface. 

Console: 
The actual prompt from the actual machine you’re manipulation

Shell: 
The prompt when you’re accessing a remote machine? 
Connect to remote machines!


ssh username@yourremotedomain.com followed by the password! That’s it.
